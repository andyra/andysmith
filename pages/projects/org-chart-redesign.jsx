            We wanted to avoid a complete overhaul on the org chart and instead
            limit our changes to the toolbar and various panels. The code that
            handled rendering was far more complex and would have involved
            back-end changes and extensive testing, and we wanted to be able to
            get something releasable in a single season.

            Since the org chart was such a critical part of our app, we wanted
            to be doubly sure that these changes wouldn&apos;t disrupt workflows
            for existing customers. As such, we needed to test not only with
            people who were new to the app, but people who were intimately
            familiar with it.

          I already knew some of the general UI conflicts we were trying to
          solve, so I started by mocking up ideas in Sketch. This was a useful
          excercise to try out a few different approaches without getting lost
          in the details.

          - Where to move the Build panel? Can it remain on the left? - Nav
          collapsible or not? - Weird to have two panels on the right? - How to
          get to Private org charts? - Is there enough room for search, filter,
          zoom, plus everything else?
        </figure>
        <p>
          I like to brainstorm excessively, without judgement, then prune out
          the ideas that are clumsy, require out-of-scope changes, or are simply
          too weird. Once I had narrowed down to a small set of reasonable
          options, I worked with the VP of Product to pick a couple to flesh out
          in more detail.

          At this point, we had narrowed it down to a couple sensible options,
          but we weren&apos;t sure which one would &ldquo;feel right.&rdquo;
          Something might look great sitting quietly on a Figma frame, but feel
          awkward when interacting in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get a better sense of how it might work, I built a React prototype
          on Next.js and published it to GitHub Pages. As a bonus, I wired up
          GitHub Actions to deploy automatically whenever I pushed changes to
          master. This ended up being a convenient way to quickly iterate and
          publish changes.

          It&apos;s certainly possible make prototypes with design tools
          (Sketch, Figma, et. al.), but I&apos;ve found that building something
          in the browser gives testers a much better sense for what the app will
          _actually_ feel like. In addition, building with code gives you so
          much more power to build bespoke prototypes and teaches useful
          programming skills. It can also speed up development since many of the
          styles and interactions can be copied over to production code. I place
          my seal upon it!

            We scheduled UI testing-sessions with a couple cohorts: existing
            customers who had developed musicle memory with our tools and
            potential customers who had never heard of Pingboard. In addition,
            we started off with a round of internal testing so we could work out
            any obvious kinks before talking to other people.
